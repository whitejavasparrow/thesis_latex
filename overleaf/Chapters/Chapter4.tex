\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{results}

Diachronic embeddings, which is trained for the purpose of tracing the change of word representations in vector space models, are met with challenges in how the training is evaluated. In this study, the trained embeddings are first examined in interactive interface in order to explore the structure of the diachronic embeddings. Furthermore, analogical reasoning and bootstrapping methods are employed as an attempt to pinpoint the properties of embeddings that might be influenced by the source data. From this perspective, the ``bias'' in an embedding is interpreted as a ``feature'', not a ``bug'' \parencite{wevers2020digital}.

\section{Collocation-based Approach}
The results of the VNC periodization are plotted as dendrograms (See \fref{fig:all_VNC}, \fref{fig:pre_VNC}, and \fref{fig:post_VNC}, and the vector tables of collograms are provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:all_jia}, \ref{appendix:pre_jia}, and \ref{appendix:post_jia}.

The correlation between the Qing dynasty and 1980s shows a drastically decreasing trend compared to that of its predecessor, the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty, marking a distinct new stage of development. Furthermore, the flattening of the line at 2 clusters in the scree plot suggests no subgroups are identified. It is generalized from the results of the \gls{vnc} method that while modern Chinese is drastically different from pre-modern Chinese, the timeframe from the Tang dynasty to the Qing dynasty shows that each dynasty is dissimilar from one another and cannot be merged, even for the shortest dynasty Yuan. The granularity of diachronic data is not equally partitioned.

\section{Word-level Embeddings}

\subsection{Evaluation on Analogical Reasoning}
Analogical thinking and context-dependent evidence lay a cognitive ground for the studies of semantic change \parencite{traugott2017semantic}. The training of word embeddings are evaluated based on intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. In terms of vector space models, analogical thinking is associated with the directionality of vectors that represent words in pairs or in groups. While tasks like similarity scoring and analogical reasoning belong to types of intrinsic evaluation methods, the analogical reasoning is more adaptable to historical data in this study, for it is criticized that evaluation datasets mainly consists of geographical entities that would be non-existent in historical time periods \parencite{wevers2020digital,li2018analogical}. Despite its popularity, wide application, and the much effort into the expansion of datasets, the analogical reasoning task is not adaptable for diachronic or historical word embeddings \parencite{wevers2020digital}.

The CA8 dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Embedding/Chinese-Word-Vectors}}, created by \textcite{li2018analogical}, is adopted to extract semantic relations, specifically analogies, in the trained diachronic character-level embeddings. While a variety of datasets and translated versions are available for the purpose of analogical reasoning, the CA8 dataset is characteristic of its attempt to not rely heavily on geographical names and proper nouns in the target analogical pairs. On the contrary, 8 relational types are included. Additionally, among the 1,307 analogical pairs in the type ``nature,'' 282 of them are single-character word pairs (or 1-gram, as categorized by \textcite{li2018analogical}), and the semantic relations are rich and elemental, including ``number, time, animal, plant, body, physics, weather, reverse, color'' \parencite{li2018analogical}. It is the two reasons that enable the possibility to extract the semantic relations in pre-modern Chinese texts.

\begin{equation}
  b' = \arg\max_{d \in V}(\cos b', b - a + a'){,}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation*}
  where\: \cos(u,v) = \frac{u \cdot v}{\lVert{u}\rVert \cdot \lVert{v}\rVert}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
  \arg\max_{b' \in V}\frac{\cos(b',b) \cos(b',a')}{\cos(b',a) + \varepsilon}{,}\: \varepsilon = 0.001
\end{equation}

By solving the pair-based \sctext{3CosAdd} and \sctext{3CosMul} objectives \parencite{levy2014linguistic}, it is found that 26 and 35 pairs are consistently identified across all time periods within smaller (window size set to 1) and larger (window size set to 5) window sizes. For example, pairs like 東-西:左-右 `east-west:left-right', 真-假:左-右 `real-fake: left-right', and 冷-熱:南-北 `cold-hot:south-north' are solved in all time periods, and the pair 冰-水:雪-雨 `ice-water:snow-rain' is also stably analogous except in 1980s. However, it has not yet been feasible to extract semantic relations with set-based objectives like \sctext{3CosAvg}, for the mean of a set of vectors from the source and target single-character words under the same category defined in the dataset do not yield more analogical pairs in this study. %Below are the results of solved coverages on the trained diachronic character-based embeddings.

\subsection{Stability of \sctext{BOOTSTRAP} Diachronic Embeddings}

The first five common query words are `公', `君', `國', `太', `官' for pre-modern Chinese, and `二', `官方', `發生', `兼', `且'. While some query words like `兼' and `且' might be considered stop words and otherwise removed, they are included to see if stop words are asserting more impact on the stability of \sctext{BOOTSTRAP} embeddings.

The results show that the bootstrap samples become stable after 25 iterations, as suggested in \textcite{antoniak2018evaluating}. 

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Mean stability over iterations based on query words extracted from LDA topic models and 20 nearest neighbors from \sctext{fixed} embeddings}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Diachronic Word Embeddings}
After word embeddings from Tang dynasty to Qing dynasty are generated, 10 words with the highest cosine similarity scores of jia are extracted from each dynasty. Character-based results are shown in Fig. 1, and word-segmented results are provided in the Appendix. It is found that character-based word embeddings yield a set of words with meanings that are closer to the definitions listed in the OED and MOE dictionaries.

Nonetheless, it is probable that zhong `burial mound' tops the list because it could be coded for its resemblance of strokes to jia, or because the word was also used to refer to the eldest male offspring in the family, as in jia-zhong and zhong-fu `wife of the eldest male offspring.' From the perspective of nearest neighboring words \parencite{hamilton2016cultural}, the core meanings of jia remains stable from pre-modern time, indicating a strong association with the family clan and the role of a wife, as in zu and qi. Secondly, the words li `village; neighborhood' and cun `village; country' are evident of the structured social unit of living from pre-modern time. However, the nearest neighboring words of li falls into the category of measurement units such as zhang `one-tenth of chi' and chi, whereas zun is still closely linked to words like zhuang `village; town' and xiang `lane; valley.' Interestingly, the most semantically related words to jia in pre-modern Chinese time depicts the idea of home more as a social concept than a physical one. If such words as zhi `nephew', zi `offspring', and sao `sister-in-law' are considered, it becomes clearer that word vectors are able to capture the cultural aspect of jia in pre-modern Chinese.

Noticeably, on the list of most similar words are two words related to money—fu `to be wealthy' and zi `to estimate (value).' Although they do not appear as frequently as the aforementioned words, they are assigned higher similarity scores than shi `era; decades' and guo `nation; feudal land', which are thought of as one aspect of core meanings of jia, as in guo-jia `nation; state.'

\gls{asbc} are representative of the concept of jia in the late 20\textsuperscript{th} and 21\textsuperscript{st} century. As \tref{tab:my_label} shows, cun-zi `village' are still closely related to the concept of jia, appearing as one of its semantically most similar words in the vectors of both window size 1 and 5. Furthermore, more words carrying the meaning of family are seen on the list of \gls{asbc}, including jia-xiao `wife and children', quan-jia `the whole family', and yi-jia `(a) family', yet zu and qi are no longer seen, which might reflect the shift of family clans as units of living to smaller household sizes and more equal status of each family member.

\end{figure}

Secondly, not the word yu `apartment', but hu `one-paneled door; household', wo `nest; hiding place', and fang `house; room' are used to refer to jia as a physical space or unit of living. Because of the emergence of these alternative words, home evolves to be a private sphere \parencite{mallett2004understanding}. These words highlight the physical aspect of meaning of jia and its characteristics under transformation. The word wo can be used either as a noun or a verb, and as a verb, it stresses that home is portrayed as a place where we feel cozy and at ease, and where we can ``retreat and relax'' \parencite{mallett2004understanding}. 

Interestingly, aside from wo as a verb, kuo-bie `to be separated for a long time' is the only verb on the list of \gls{asbc}  \parencite{mallett2004understanding,samanani2019house}. Besides, terms of commercial properties are spurring in the list of most similar words to jia, including jiu-dian `hotel', can-quan `restaurant; bistro', lu-quan `hotel', xiao-chi dian `eatery.' It is speculated that commercialization is accountable for this new trend, but it is also possible that jia starts to be used as a classifier, as in yi-jia-lu-quan `one hotel.' Judging from the data in \gls{asbc}, it is seen that not only does the concept of jia changes across time, but the word use of jia changes as well, which is evident in more alternative word choices to refer to the concept of jia. 

In the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, the word jia is associated with a wider variety of words, mostly verbs. Unlike data from earlier time spans, the words are less semantically associated with the direct naming of a physical space or family unit, but because people engage themselves more an d more often in describing their daily life and encounters, verbs like li-kai `to leave', qan shou `to-feel', shang-hai `to hurt', and pei-ban `to accompany' are assigned the highest probabilities to words of jia. 

Although word embedding technique grows increasingly prevalent in the field of computational linguistics and natural language processing, it has been criticized for representing words with multiple meanings as one single vector, which is referred to as ``meaning conflation deficiency'' \parencite{camacho2018survey} To allow the algorithms to know different senses of the same word form, two main methods for sense embeddings are proposed. [21, 22] One is unsupervised as senses are ``induced'' from the training corpora; the other is knowledge-based, meaning external sense inventories, such as WordNet, are required to fine-tune the word vector models. 

Since the keyword jia does not reveal how people are connected in this recent era, 2 other keywords are chosen to see if more insights can be gained. The words jia-ren and jia-ting can help us understand the social structure of home nowadays. As the above figure shows, the concept of jia is first depicted with a single word jia, and as time passes, jia is conceptualized with multiple other lexical items. In other words, in earlier time, different aspects of home are described by the character jia, yet these aspects are embodied with different words such as jia ren-ren and jia-ting in modern Chinese texts.

\section{Sense-level Embeddings}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures_new/diachronic_sense_modeling/家_zh.png}
  \caption{Diachronic interactions of senses}
  \label{fig:jia_polynomial}
\end{figure}

The extraction of contextualized embeddings allows for a sketch of usage distribution displayed by proportion and interactions of different senses, as shown in \fref{fig:jia_polynomial}.

From \fref{fig:jia_polynomial}, it is shown that senses do compete and cooperate semantically. In present-day Chinese, sense 1 (family), sense 3 (house), and sense 7 (-ist) are shown to be three of the most prominent senses, yet sense 1 does not evolve in identical direction with sense 3 and 7 in Song and Ming. Instead, its rise of sense 1 has indicated that single-character words like \jia can be read as `family', and combined with sense 3, they account for over 60 percent of the usage proportion, while sense 7 is only half of it. Interestingly, both sense 7 and 8 carry the meaning of describing someone's profession, but the contextualized embeddings distinguish the two readings in terms of the percentage. Qualitatively, these are influenced by different schools of thought. Furthermore, it is comparatively rare for \jia to serve as adjective `domestic', or sense 10 as categorical name.

Firstly, Sense 1 and Sense 3 have the highest proportions in the 1980s. This prevalence follows a rapid growth in the use of the two senses. Nonetheless, the evolvement of Sense 3 is more non-monotonous than that of Sense 1 although the two senses start to share a similar upward trend from the Qing dynasty. It is also interesting that Sense 2 takes up around 2\% to 5\% (5.3\%, 2.4\%, 5.1\%, 2.9\%, 2.4\% from the Tang to Qing dynasty respectively) of the overall proportion in pre-modern Chinese. Semantically, both Sense 2 and 3 can be used to refer to \jia as a physical entity, whereas Sense 1 describes \jia as a social unit, as in \exref{ex:family} to \exref{ex:house_1980s}. 

The fluctuation of Sense 3 might be a result of the distinguishment of this sense from a similar one, Sense 2, as exemplified in \exref{ex:settle_down}.  In contrast, the upward curve of Sense 1 is sharpe, which embodies the expression of \jia as a social unit. Yet, it is also found that the results of these three senses include sentences with bi-grams of \jia that do not have a corresponding pre-determined sense, e.g., \zh{國[家]}{guójiā}{country; state}, \zh{奴[家]}{nújiā}{your servant (humble self-reference by young female)}, as in \exref{ex:country} and \exref{ex:your_servant}. When a belonging sense is unavailable, it is challenging to disambiguiate the meanings given the token representations. It is especially attributable if an example sentence contains wider context information that obscures the results.

In modern Chinese, Sense 7, 8, 9 are profession-related senses, as in \zh{美聲[家]}{měishēngjiā}{bel canto singer}, \zh{樵[家]和獵[家]}{qiáojiā hàn lièjiā}{woodman and hunter}, and \zh{儒墨兩[家]}{rúmòliǎngjiā}{the Confucian and Mohist schools}. Despite being semantically similar, only Sense 8 and 9 evolve cooperatively, whereas Sense 7 is seen to compete against these two senses. A steep downward curve is seen for both Sense 8 and Sense 9 in the Qing dynasty (from 24.8\% and 15.5\% in the Qing dynasty to 3.7\% and 2.5\% in the 1980s), while Sense 7 surges in use during the same time period, and continues to be more and more prominent in the 1980s (from 2.2\% in the Qing dynasty to 17.6\% in the 1980s). Professions like \zh{醫[家]}{yījiā}{doctor}, \zh{史[家]}{shǐjiā}{historian}, and \zh{詩[家]}{shījiā}{poet}, as in \exref{ex:doctor} through \exref{ex:poet}, are mapped to Sense 7 in pre-modern Chinese, and a wide variety of occupations are included for the same sense in modern Chinese, which contributes to the rise and prominence of Sense 7 in the 1980s.

On top of that, regarding the proportion of usage, Sense 10, 11, and 12 consistently rank the lowest in pre-modern Chinese, but a sudden increase is witnessed for Sense 11 and 12 in the 1980s. Among all the 18 senses of \jia\rspace , Sense 12 is the only one acting as a classifier, or Nf in the \gls{asbc} tagset.

Sense-level embeddings are capable of capturing fine-grained senses and their evolution, yet the contextual information provided from pre-modern Chinese sentences might not be sufficient enough to accurately map the token representations to their belonging senses from the pre-trained language model.

The polysemy of a lexical item is addressed by constructing multiple contextualized token embeddings. Shades of meanings are reflected in the diversity of contextual use.

The results indicate that \jia enjoy far global distance but low local distance, and suddenly rises during 1980s.

\section{Discussion}
Following \textcite{hamilton2016law}, in which the evaluation is based on examples from previous works on semantic change and words with the ``obsolete'' tag in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), dictionary entries are consulted to look for ``舊時'' and ``古代'' for attested examples to evaluate the trained diachronic word embeddings.

For example, \zh{齒}{chǐ}{tooth} used to carry the meaning `age (年齡)' and `being of equal rank (並列)' because age determination is made by numbering horses' teeth, which emerges one each year, as in `子之齒長矣，不能事人 (You are long in the tooth)' and `不敢與諸任齒 (I would not dare to take rank equivalent to yours)'; another example is \zh{卑鄙}{bēi-bǐ}{despicable}, which is more neural in connotation in the past \parencite[前言]{wang1997gujinyiyi}. Dictionaries include \textcite{wang1997gujinyiyi,liu1992gujinyi}, which lists word entries with meanings that are distinctive between modern and pre-modern times. Detailed information relevant to semantic change is the number of disyllabic word entries, whether the word convey connotations with varying sentiment polarities, and whether certain senses fall into disuse nowadays, which is valuable resources for the comparison with the results of computational methods.

The meanings are based on 漢語大字典, 漢語大詞典, 辭源, 辭海 as well as 現代漢語詞典 and 新華詞典 (both published by 商務印書館).

frequency data is derived from 在线古代汉语语料库字频数据\footnote{\url{http://corpus.zhonghuayuwen.org/resources.aspx}} and 近代漢語語料庫詞頻統計\footnote{\url{https://elearning.ling.sinica.edu.tw/jindai.html}}, which are the metadata from the 70-million-word Ancient Chinese Corpus (在线古代汉语语料库) by the Ministry of Education, China and Academia Sinica Tagged Corpus of Early Mandarin Chinese (近代漢語語料庫) by Academia Sinica, Taiwan.

The case study of \jia is based on the assumption that the time-sliced corpus might reflect the similar and different descriptions in language use. While words in \tref{use_case} fall into the categories of technological innovations and ideologies, this study chooses \jia because of its linguistic and cultural characteristics. In pre-modern Chinese, \jia is associated with words that denote physical objects like house.

Because the corpus contains multiple versions of a document, some orthographically-similar characters rank top in terms of cosine similarity scores. However, if compared with the results from \sctext{BOOTSTRAP} samples, the scores are widest. In addition, the ranks vary widely in different iterations, and are a reliable indicator of neighbor analysis. For example, \zh{貧}{pín}{poor;impoverished} appear 43 times out of the 50 iterations as the top 20 closest neighbors, followed by \zh{窶}{jù}{poor;impoverished} also appear 26 times. Other closest neighbors include 族, 世, 妻, 冢, 富, \zh{寠}{jù}{poor;impoverished}, 孀, 糿, 父 (all more than 15 times.)

As for the word 宅, the closest neighbors include 田(48), 廨(47), 居(39), 園(36), 墅(36), 家(35), and 廛(14), filtering out 冢(1). Compared with \sctext{FIXED} embeddings, the closest neighbors for the Tang dynasty include 廨, 田, 宇, 邸, 園, 營, 室, 塋, 寺, 住, 妝, 寓. Therefore, if neighbor analysis can be compared from two directions, it is likely to mitigate the issue arising from OCR errors?

The semantic history of linguistic units or expressions are far more unpredictable than data that contain seasonality. Regarding the closet neighbors for \jia , the results differ in a distinctive way, with a low percentage of overlaps between the \sctext{FIXED} embeddings and the \sctext{BOOTSTRAP} ones. In addition, before the diachronic character-based embeddings are constructed, a decision needs to be made on whether the different versions of a workset of texts are to be included or excluded. Considering the fact that the documents are converted from scanned copies to the digital texts in UTF-8 encoding using the OCR technique, the \sctext{FIXED} embeddings reinforce the parts that are consistently recognizable and transformed into similar strings of characters. In other words, the inclusion of all versions in a workset of documents prevents misrecognized characters from taking up a significant portion of the word occurrence behavior. On the other hand, the word co-occurrence profile remains susceptible to orthographically highly similar characters, e.g., 家 and 冢, 人 and 入, and 怡 and 恰, and place the mistaken form as the close neighbors, oftentimes the closest neighbor.
