\chapter{Results}

Unfortunately, diachronic embeddings, which is trained for the purpose of tracing the change of word representations in vector space models, are met with challenges in how the training is evaluated. In this study, the trained embeddings are first examined in interactive interface in order to explore the structure of the diachronic embeddings. Furthermore, analogical reasoning and bootstrapping methods are employed as an attempt to pinpoint the properties of embeddings that might be influenced by the source data.

\section{Evaluation on analogical reasoning}

Analogical thinking and context-dependent evidence lay a cognitive ground for the studies of semantic change \parencite{traugott2017semantic}. The training of word embeddings are evaluated based on intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. In terms of vector space models, analogical thinking is associated with the directionality of vectors that represent words in pairs or in groups. While tasks like similarity scoring and analogical reasoning belong to types of intrinsic evaluation methods, the analogical reasoning is more adapatable to historical data in this study, for it is criticized that evaluation datasets mainly consists of geographical entities that would be non-existent in historical time periods \parencite{wevers2020digital,li2018analogical}. Despite its popularity, wide application, and the much effort into the expansion of datasets, the analogical reasoning task is not adaptable for diachronic or historical word embeddings \parencite{wevers2020digital}.

In our pilot study, the CA8 dataset, established by \textcite{li2018analogical}, is adopted to explore semantic relations in the trained embeddings. The dataset 8 does not rely heavily on geographical locations and proper nouns as the target. Instead, 8 relational types are included; in particular, among the 1,307 analogical word pairs in the type of “nature,” 282 of them are single-character word pairs, and the semantic relations are rich and elemental, including ``number, time, animal, plant, body, physics, weather, reverse, color'' \parencite{li2018analogical}. By solving the \textsc{3COSADD} and \textsc{3COSMUL} objectives \parencite{levy2014linguistic}, we found that 26 and 35 word pairs are successfully identified across all time periods within small and large window sizes. For example, pairs like 東-西:左-右 `east-west:left-right', 真-假:左-右 `realfake: left-right', and 冷-熱:南-北 `cold-hot:south-north', are solved in all time periods, and the pair 冰-水:雪-雨 `ice-water:snow-rain' is also stably analogous except in 1980s. Based on the preliminary findings, we will continue the extraction and analysis of analogous pairs. Firstly, we will develop a list of word pairs derived from existing datasets (e.g., Google testset, BATS testset), dictionaries, thesauri, and the Chinese WordNet sense inventory. Then, the list will be used for the pair-based methods. The coverage of solved pairs indicates the inverted degrees of semantic change in analogous pairs. From this perspective, the ``bias'' in an embedding is interpreted as a ``feature'', not a ``bug'' \parencite{wevers2020digital}. Below are the preliminary results of solved coverages on our trained diachronic character embeddings. 

\section{Stability of \textsc{BOOTSTRAP} diachronic embeddings}

The first 5 common query words are `公', `君', `國', `太', `官' for pre-modern Chinese, and `二', `官方', `發生', `兼', `且'. While some query words like `兼' and `且' might be considered stop words and otherwise removed, they are included to see if stop words are asserting more impact on the stability of \textsc{BOOTSTRAP} embeddings.

The results show that the bootstrap samples become stable after 25 iterations, as suggested in \textcite{antoniak2018evaluating}.

The correlation between the Qing dynasty and 1980s shows a drastically decreasing trend compared to that of its predecessor, the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty, marking a distinct new stage of development. Furthermore, the flattening of the line at 2 clusters in the scree plot suggests no subgroups are identified. It is generalized from the results of the \gls{vnc} method that while modern Chinese is drastically different from pre-modern Chinese, the timeframe from the Tang dynasty to the Qing dynasty shows that each dynasty is dissimilar from one another and cannot be merged, even for the shortest dynasty Yuan. The granularity of diachronic data is not equally partitioned.

After word embeddings from Tang dynasty to Qing dynasty are generated, 10 words with the highest cosine similarity scores of jia are extracted from each dynasty. Character-based results are shown in Fig. 1, and word-segmented results are provided in the Appendix. It is found that character-based word embeddings yield a set of words with meanings that are closer to the definitions listed in the OED and MOE dictionaries.

Nonetheless, it is probable that zhong `burial mound' tops the list because it could be coded for its resemblance of strokes to jia, or because the word was also used to refer to the eldest male offspring in the family, as in jia-zhong and zhong-fu `wife of the eldest male offspring.' From the perspective of nearest neighboring words \parencite{hamilton2016cultural}, the core meanings of jia remains stable from pre-modern time, indicating a strong association with the family clan and the role of a wife, as in zu and qi. Secondly, the words li `village; neighborhood' and cun `village; country' are evident of the structured social unit of living from pre-modern time. However, the nearest neighboring words of li falls into the category of measurement units such as zhang `one-tenth of chi' and chi, whereas zun is still closely linked to words like zhuang `village; town' and xiang `lane; valley.' Interestingly, the most semantically related words to jia in pre-modern Chinese time depicts the idea of home more as a social concept than a physical one. If such words as zhi `nephew', zi `offspring', and sao `sister-in-law' are considered, it becomes clearer that word vectors are able to capture the cultural aspect of jia in pre-modern Chinese. 
Noticeably, on the list of most similar words are two words related to money—fu `to be wealthy' and zi `to estimate (value).' Although they do not appear as frequently as the aforementioned words, they are assigned higher similarity scores than shi `era; decades' and guo `nation; feudal land', which are thought of as one aspect of core meanings of jia, as in guo-jia `nation; state.'

\gls{asbc} and Dcard are representative of the concept of jia in the late 20\textsuperscript{th} and 21\textsuperscript{st} century. As Table 2 shows, cun-zi `village' are still closely related to the concept of jia, appearing as one of its semantically most similar words in the vectors of both window size 1 and 5. Furthermore, more words carrying the meaning of family are seen on the list of \gls{asbc}, including jia-xiao `wife and children', quan-jia `the whole family', and yi-jia `(a) family', yet zu and qi are no longer seen, which might reflect the shift of family clans as units of living to smaller household sizes and more equal status of each family member. 

Secondly, not the word yu `apartment', but hu `one-paneled door; household', wo `nest; hiding place', and fang `house; room' are used to refer to jia as a physical space or unit of living. Because of the emergence of these alternative words, home evolves to be a private sphere \parencite{mallett2004understanding}. These words highlight the physical aspect of meaning of jia and its characteristics under transformation. The word wo can be used either as a noun or a verb, and as a verb, it stresses that home is portrayed as a place where we feel cozy and at ease, and where we can ``retreat and relax'' \parencite{mallett2004understanding}. 

Interestingly, aside from wo as a verb, kuo-bie `to be separated for a long time' is the only verb on the list of \gls{asbc}, and the concept of home as a ``journeying'' experience recurs in the Dcard corpus, as in li-kai `to leave' \parencite{mallett2004understanding,samanani2019house}. Besides, terms of commercial properties are spurring in the list of most similar words to jia, including jiu-dian `hotel', can-quan `restaurant; bistro', lu-quan `hotel', xiao-chi dian `eatery.' It is speculated that commercialization is accountable for this new trend, but it is also possible that jia starts to be used as a classifier, as in yi-jia-lu-quan `one hotel.' Judging from the data in \gls{asbc}, it is seen that not only does the concept of jia changes across time, but the word use of jia changes as well, which is evident in more alternative word choices to refer to the concept of jia. 

In the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, the word jia is associated with a wider variety of words, mostly verbs. Unlike data from earlier time spans, the words are less semantically associated with the direct naming of a physical space or family unit, but because people engage themselves more an d more often in describing their daily life and encounters, verbs like li-kai `to leave', qan shou `to-feel', shang-hai `to hurt', and pei-ban `to accompany' are assigned the highest probabilities to words of jia. 

Although word embedding technique grows increasingly prevalent in the field of computational linguistics and natural language processing, it has been criticized for representing words with multiple meanings as one single vector, which is referred to as ``meaning conflation deficiency'' \parencite{camacho2018survey} To allow the algorithms to know different senses of the same word form, two main methods for sense embeddings are proposed. [21, 22] One is unsupervised as senses are ``induced'' from the training corpora; the other is knowledge-based, meaning external sense inventories, such as WordNet, are required to fine-tune the word vector models. 

Since the keyword jia does not reveal how people are connected in this recent era, 2 other keywords are chosen to see if more insights can be gained. The words jia-ren and jia-ting can help us understand the social structure of home nowadays. As the above figure shows, the concept of jia is first depicted with a single word jia, and as time passes, jia is conceptualized with multiple other lexical items. In other words, in earlier time, different aspects of home are described by the character jia, yet these aspects are embodied with different words such as jia ren-ren and jia-ting in modern Chinese texts.

    \label{fig:jia_en}
\end{figure}

The extraction of contextualized embeddings allows for a sketch of usage distribution displayed by proportion and interactions of different senses. From \fref{jia_en}, it is shown that senses do compete and cooperate semantically. In present-day Chinese, sense 1 (family), sense 3 (house), and sense 7 (-ist) are shown to be three of the most prominent senses, yet sense 1 does not evolve in identical direction with sense 3 and 7 in Song and Ming. Instead, its rise of sense 1 has indicated that single-character words like \jia can be read as `family', and combined with sense 3, they account for over 60 percent of the usage proportion, while sense 7 is only half of it. Interestingly, both sense 7 and 8 carry the meaning of describing someone's profession, but the contextualized embeddings distinguish the two readings in terms of the percentage. Qualitatively, these are influenced by different schools of thought. Furthermore, it is comparatively rare for \jia to serve as adjective `domestic', or sense 10 as categorial name.

The polysemy of a lexical item is addressed by constructing multiple contextualized token embeddings. Shades of meanings are reflected in the diversity of contextual use.

The results indicate that \jia enjoy far global distance but low local distance, and suddenly rises during 1980s.
