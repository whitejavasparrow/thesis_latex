\chapter{Introduction}
\textcite{renouf2002time} recognizes the importance of digitally storing both historical and modern textual data. ``We need the past in order to understand the present. An amalgamation would increase the scope, timespan and continuity of resources, whilst lessening the inconvenience of having to switch from one corpus and set of tools to another'' \parencite{renouf2002time}. Although automatic data crawling and real-time processing makes it possible to build a dynamic, chronological web corpus of present-day language use, as written texts comprise a major part of existing corpora, it is a turning point to explore the diachrony of the data along with the lately available texts from historical periods.
