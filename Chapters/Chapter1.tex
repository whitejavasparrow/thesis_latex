\chapter{Introduction}
Language is constantly changing and evolving. The emergence of new senses, the demise of old ones, and the polysemous nature of lexical items make the process of semantic change a dynamic phenomenon. As individuals learn new words and meanings throughout their life, so does a language \parencite{rychly2008lexicographer}. While recent studies have used time-sliced collections of texts to observe swift meaning changes, the digitalization of texts from earlier time periods opens up research opportunities that incorporates a corpus-driven approach to trace the diachronic development of words and their meanings %\parencite{kutuzov2018survey,tahmasebi2018survey,camacho2018survey}.
